# Heart_Risk_Prediction
An end-to-end clinical risk prediction pipeline that processes medical data, builds features, trains machine‑learning models, and evaluates patient outcome predictions.

# Clinical ML Project — Heart Failure Clinical Records

An end-to-end, modular machine learning pipeline for clinical tabular data.  
This template downloads (or accepts a manual ZIP), cleans data, builds features, trains a baseline model, and evaluates performance with standard classification metrics.
## ✨ Features

- **Data ingestion**: Kaggle CLI or manual ZIP/CSV drop-in
- **Data cleaning**: de-duplication & simple NA strategy
- **Feature pipeline**: numeric scaling, stratified split
- **Modeling**: Logistic Regression baseline (easily swappable)
- **Evaluation**: classification report; optional ROC curve & confusion matrix
- **Project structure**: clear separation of data, code, models, and reports
